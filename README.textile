h2. About oUF_Quaiche

This is my personal oUF layout. While I appreciate comments and suggestions, this is for MY personal UI so I
am unlikely to change anything for you. 

Before you ask, there are NO buffs or debuffs shown on the frames. This is by design as I use other addons to 
manage and display my buffs. You are welcome to change the code if you want them in your layout.

This layout DOES NOT require a separate installation of oUF to function.

Provides the following Unit Frames
* Player
* Target
* Target of Target 
* Focus
* Focus Target
* Pet
* Party
* Party Pets
* Raid

h2. Moving the frames

In addition to making the layout standalone, I have also embedded haste's oUF_MovableFrames code into the layout. To
unlock the frames for moving, type

<pre>/oufq</pre>

Once you're done moving them, you can relock them by repeating the same slash command. To reset the frames back to their
original positions, open the options panel for oUF_Quaiche and remove the points from the list.
