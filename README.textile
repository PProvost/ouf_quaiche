h2. About oUF_Quaiche

This is my personal oUF layout. While I appreciate comments and suggestions, this is for MY personal UI so I am unlikely to change anything for you. 

Before you ask, there are NO buffs or debuffs shown on the frames. This is by design as I use other addons to manage and display my buffs. You are welcome to change
the code if you want them in your layout.

This layout DOES NOT require a separate installation of oUF to function. oUF and oUF_MovableFrames are both embedded.

Provides the following Unit Frames
* Player
* Target
* Target of Target 
* Focus
* Focus Target
* Pet
* Party
* Party Pets
* Raid
