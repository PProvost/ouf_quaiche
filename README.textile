h2. About oUF_Quaiche

__NOTE: Starting with v2.1 there are no longer any Buff/Debuff icons on the player or target frames. I have changed my UI to use SatrinaBuffFrames for these aura icons, so no longer need them in my layout.__

This is my personal oUF layout. While I appreciate comments and suggestions, this is for MY personal UI so I am unlikely to change anything for you. 

This addon DOES NOT require a separate installation of oUF to function. oUF is embedded.

Provides the following Unit Frames
* Player
* Target
* Target of Target 
* Focus
* Focus Target
* Pet
* Party
* Party Pets
* Raid
